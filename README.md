# Q2 Project Proposal

## Website title: Fragments of a Murder
This website is a game that is inspired by Block Blast, an app that includes block puzzles. We decided to put a twist to this game by watching videos but adding a story. In each chapter, there is a chance where the videos are repeated, so the user would have to persevere in order to find out more about the story. Once the game is finished, you will get a prize. We decided to name this game Fragments of a Murder since the story is about finding the murderer of one of the people who was killed in a dinner party by watching videos in each chapter.
