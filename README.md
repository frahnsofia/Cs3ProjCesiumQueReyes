# Q2 Project Proposal

## Website title: Fragments of a Murder
This website is a game that is inspired by Block Blast, an app that includes block puzzles. We decided to put a twist to this game by not only making puzzles but adding a story. In each chapter, there will be challenges that get harder and harder everytime. Once the game is finished, you will get a prize. We decided to name this game Fragments of a Murder since the story is about finding the murderer of one of the people who was killed in a dinner party by solving the block puzzles in each chapter.
