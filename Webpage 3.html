  <h1> Fragments of a Murder (Chapter 3) </h1>
(Puzzle. Once accomplished, the story will continue)
<br>
<h1>1. Diana Lane</h1>
Nana:"What were you doing before the incident?"
<br>
Diana:"I ate, went to the bathroom to fix my hair and makeup, but while I was in the bathroom 
I saw a bottle of poison peeking under the tissues in the trash can. I then went to the garden to 
see everyone outside panicking and screaming at the dead body. I don't know how any of this 
happened it just did..."
<br>
Nana: "Were you drunk?"
<br>
Diana: "No miss."
<br>
Nana:"Did you see anything that could cause harm?"
<br>
Diana:"No miss. Nothing at all but a bottle of poison."
<br>
<h1>2. Ada Lane</h1>
Nana:"What were you doing before the incident?"
<br>
Ada:"I ate my food and only took a sip of wine but after I felt a little ill, I decided not to continue
drinking since I knew I would get worse. I went upstairs to his room and had a fun talk with Demetri after 
a long time of no contact and after a few minutes he told me he'll take a break and go to the garden for
some fresh air but he seemed pale. I decided to let it slide and think he was just a little sick aswell 
so I let him get some fresh air. While I was alone in his office, I checked the cabinets only to see letters
from Mr. Hikoro that had a bunch of death threats in it. I heard people screaming so I rush downstairs to see 
him dead. Then I looked at Mr. Hikoro who was at the very back of the scene smiling slightly, swirling his wine
glass."
<br>
Nana: "Were you drunk?"
<br>
Ada: "No miss. I have high tolerance."
<br>
Nana:"Did you see any weapons or anything unusual?"
<br>
Ada:"A pocket knife in his office drawer. With the initials 'D.L' written in the handle. However, there
was no blood in it. I suppose it might be his considering his initials are also D.L."
<br>
<h1>3. Kenji Hikoro</h1>
Nana:"What were you doing before the incident?"
<br>
Kenji:"Ate of course, kept drinking and felt sick so I threw up in the bathroom. I don't remember much
but the dead body and a letter containing elements in it. That's all"
<br>
Nana:"Did you see any unusual things?"
<br>
Kenji:"No miss. Nothing at all."
<br>
<h1>4. Alias Wintringham</h1>
Nana:"What were you doing before the incident?"
<br>
Alias:"I didn't eat during the party. All I did was walk around the house then sat on the couch. I decided to
go home early due to the blandness of the party. It was the day after where I received the news."
<br>
Nana:"Did you see any unusual objects while walking around?"
<br>
Alias:"Just a bottle of poison in the bathroom. However I did not touch it due to my fear of getting hurt if I
did."
<br>
<h1>5. Mr. Williams</h1>
Nana:"What were you doing before the incident?"
<br>
Mr. Williams:"I ate a lot of food and talked for hours with Demetri and my wife while we were eating. Right after
that, I drank wine in the bar with Mr. Hikoro who was bugging me a whole lot. I had no interest in him but he 
continued to have a conversation either way. I got mad and stormed off to the garden, only to see my best friend
on the floor, lifeless with my wife crying for help. I had dropped my wine glass and rushed to him, shaking his 
body to see if I could wake him up but he didn't. I will miss that man like he was my brother."
<br>
Nana:"Did you see anything that can cause harm?"
<br>
Mr. Williams:"No miss."
<br>
<h1>6. Mrs. Williams</h1>
Nana:"What were you doing before the incident?"
<br>
Mrs. Williams:"I ate my food and talked with my husband and Demetri. Then, I went to the garden for some fresh air, and
heard Demetri groan in pain and drop on the floor with foam coming out of his mouth. I rush to him and scream for help
and later saw my husband going to the garden so I tell him to help me. He rushed to shake Demetri but he wouldn't wake up.
That was the start of everyone rushing downstairs to see the scene."
<br>
Nana: "Were you drunk?"
<br>
Mrs. Williams: "Not at all."
<br>
Nana:"Did you see any weapons?"
<br>
Mrs. Williams:"I didn't find anything."
<br>
<h1>7. Ms. Lee</h1>
Nana:"What were you doing before the incident?"
<br>
Ms. Lee:"I didn't eat but just drank some wine. After feeling tipsy, I chose to stop drinking and felt the urge to go
to the bathroom so I rushed there and after using the bathroom, I left only to see everyone in the garden. I was the
last one to see the scene."
<br>
Nana:"Did you see anything unusual?"
<br>
Ms. Lee:"A bottle of poison that was empty already. It layed in the trash can but it was visible enough to be seen.
