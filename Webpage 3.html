<h1>1. Diana Lane</h1>
Nana:"What were you doing before the incident?"
<br>
Diana:"I ate, went to the bathroom to fix my hair and makeup, but while I was in the bathroom 
I saw a bottle of poison peeking under the tissues in the trash can. I then went to the garden to 
see everyone outside panicking and screaming at the dead body. I don't know how any of this 
happened it just did..."

<h1>2. Ada Lane</h1>
Nana:"What were you doing before the incident?"
<br>
Ada:"I ate my food and only took a sip of wine but after I felt a little ill, I decided not to continue
drinking since I knew I would get worse. I went upstairs to his room and had a fun talk with Demetri after 
a long time of no contact and after a few minutes he told me he'll take a break and go to the garden for
some fresh air but he seemed pale. I decided to let it slide and think he was just a little sick aswell 
so I let him get some fresh air. While I was alone in his office, I checked the cabinets only to see letters
from Mr. Hikoro that had a bunch of death threats in it. I heard people screaming so I rush downstairs to see 
him dead. Then I looked at Mr. Hikoro who was at the very back of the scene smiling slightly, swirling his wine
glass."
<br>
Nana: "Were you drunk?"
<br>
Ada: "No miss. I have high tolerance."
<br>
Nana:"Did you see any weapons?"
<br>
Ada:"A pocket knife in his office drawer. With the initials 'D.L' written in the handle. However, there
was no blood in it. I suppose it might be his considering his initials are also D.L."
