(Puzzle. Once accomplished, the story will continue)
<br>
<h1>1. Diana Lane</h1>
Nana:"What were you doing before the incident?"
<br>
Diana:"I ate, went to the bathroom to fix my hair and makeup, but while I was in the bathroom 
I saw a bottle of poison peeking under the tissues in the trash can. I then went to the garden to 
see everyone outside panicking and screaming at the dead body. I don't know how any of this 
happened it just did..."
<br>
Nana: "Were you drunk?"
<br>
Diana: "No miss."
<br>
Nana:"Did you see any weapons?"
<br>
Diana:"No miss. Nothing at all but a bottle of poison."
<br>
<h1>2. Ada Lane</h1>
Nana:"What were you doing before the incident?"
<br>
Ada:"I ate my food and only took a sip of wine but after I felt a little ill I
decided not to continue drinking since I knew I would get worse. "
<br>
Nana: "Were you drunk?"
<br>
Ada: "No miss. I have high tolerance."
<br>
Nana:"Did you see any weapons?"
<br>
Ada:"A pocket knife. With the initials 'D.L' written in the handle. However, there was no blood in it.
I suppose it might be his considering his initials are also D.L. "
