Great! Now that you have finished the second puzzle here is the list:
<br>
1. Diana Lane (Demetri's wife)
<br>

<br>
3. Kenji Hikoro (One of his rivals)
<br>

  These were the seven people in the dinner party. Now that you know this case's suspects, 
we are to ask them questions and solve puzzles to find clues. Your role is to continue to
