  <br>
  Diana:"I ate, went to the bathroom to fix my hair and makeup, but while I was in the bathroom 
  I saw a bottle of poison peeking under the tissues in the trash can. I then went to the garden to 
  see everyone outside panicking and screaming at the dead body. I don't know how any of this

  <h1>7. Ms. Lee</h1>
  Nana:"What were you doing before the incident?"
  <br>
  Ms. Lee:"I didn't eat but just drank some wine. After feeling tipsy, I chose to stop drinking and felt the urge to go
  to the bathroom so I rushed there and after using the bathroom, I left only to see everyone in the garden. I was the
  last one to see the scene."
  <br>
  Nana:"Did you see anything unusual?"
  <br>
  Ms. Lee:"A bottle of poison that was empty already. It layed in the trash can but it was visible enough to be seen."
