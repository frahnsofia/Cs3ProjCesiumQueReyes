  <h1>Fragments of a Murder (Chapter 2)</h1>

  <p>
    It looks like Demetri here has some unread letters. One letter says:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    "Dear Mr. Lane, I know you are not well right now.  
    But I need to tell you that you owe me 15k dollars since last year.  
    I am sure you are in bad shape right now considering that you are failing with the selling of your books.  
    However, if you don't send me my money by next month, I will gladly get you arrested for such a problem.  
    I want my money back and I want it as soon as possible. I tried to be sympathetic to you considering your state,  
    but as we know, we are known enemies of the town and it is only a rare occasion that I have let you borrow my money.  
    Now I understand the reason for my hate towards you, Mr. Lane. This is your last call. I want my money!  
    - Mr. Wintringham"
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Wow. It looks like they truly do hate each other. I wonder how Mr. Wintringham is doing knowing he didn't get his money yet.  
    And Mr. Lane? That name seems to be for the people who he dislikes. Everyone else calls him by his first name.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moving on, here's the second letter from Mr. Hikoro:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    "Mr. Lane. I do not want to start this letter with anything formal so I will just get straight to the point.  
    My daughter has told me you have forced her to read and purchase one of your books.  
    I shall inform you that this is unacceptable behavior coming from a man that was well-taught in his years as a child.  
    I would like you to apologize for this offensive act and not by letter but by person-to-person.  
    If you don't arrive here by next week, I shall get you arrested, and I know this is not a valid excuse to put you to prison,  
    but I have a whole list of reasons why you should be put there. After all, I am your enemy and you have done many bad things to me.  
    I am done with all your offenses. This is your last chance, Mr. Lane. - Mr. Hikoro"
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    These people seem to be enemies of Demetri, but they were part of the dinner party.  
    Because of this, we shall add them to our list of suspects.  
    Now, let us see our <a href="updated.html">updated</a> list of suspects.
