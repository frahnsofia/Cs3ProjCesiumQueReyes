  <h1> Fragments of a Murder (Chapter 4) </h1>
  (Puzzle. Once accomplished, the story will continue)
  <br>
  So it was Hikoro! I knew it! He said in his statement that all he could remember is Demetri's death and the letter
  with elements on it but how could he see the letter if it was said earlier that it was still unopened? This means
  he wrote it!
  <br>
  Hikoro:"Unfair I say, unfair! All I wanted was an apology and what did he do? Ignore me! Fine I'll admit it. I did
  kill him. And yes, I was the reason for his failure in selling his books. I took his books, ripped them apart, and
  burned them. But what can I say? He deserved it. He deserved all of this and I do not regret it one bit. You people
  can call me evil but I have my reasons. And my reasons are valid! Not only did he ruin my reputation but hurt my
  daughter as well! Curse you Demetri. I said curse you!"
