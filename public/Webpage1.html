      Welcome to the first chapter of this game! I am Nana, the detective of this case who is glad to see you. There has been news 
      around the city that a murder has occured during the party. A writer named Demetri was last seen in the garden with a letter in his
      hand, unopened with ingredients written on it mainly with the elements, lead, mercury, and manganese. He was last seen with Lady Ada 
      who is the sister of Diana, Demetri's wife. Could you help me figure out who is the culprit of this case?
