  <h1> Fragments of a Murder (Chapter 1) </h1>
     Welcome to the first chapter of this game! I am Nana. The host of the dinner party who is glad to see you, our dearest detective! 
There has been news around the city that a murder has occured during the party. A writer named Demetri was last seen in the garden with 
a letter in his hand with ingredients written on it mainly with the elements, lead, mercury, and manganese. Could you help me figure out who is the culprit of this case?
